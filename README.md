Template for a Python library

This repository contains a template for a Python library.

* `Notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks with exporatory analyses and experiments,
* `lib` contains a _Python_ library with reusable bits of code (e.g. helper functions),
* `data` can be used to store data. It is *not* managed under version control. 

The _Python_ library can be installed in edit mode as follows:
```
pip install -e lib/
```

```
cd data
bash get_data.sh
```
