Template for a python library

This repository contains a template for a python library.

* `Notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks with exporatory analyses and experiments,
* `lib` contains a _python_ library with reusable bits of code (e.g. helper functions),
* `data` can be used to store data. It is *not* managed under version control. 

The _python_ library can be installed in edit mode as follows:
```
pip install -e lib/
```
